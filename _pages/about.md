Welcome to my personal academic website!

I am Qi ZHANG (张琦 in Chinese) and I was born in Taian and raised in Qingdao.

Currently, I am a research assistant professor in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/) (from 11/2022). I work with Prof. [Zhen-Yu Yin](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/people/academic-staff/dr-zhen-yu-yin/). Prior to joining PolyU, I received my Ph.D. degree in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) in June 2021, advised by Prof. [Ronaldo I. Borja](https://web.stanford.edu/~borja/). My Ph.D. thesis is **MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF UNCONVENTIONAL GEOMATERIALS**. I received my B.Eng. degree from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) in July 2016 with an undergraduate minor degree in Applied Mathematics.


My research interest focuses on the poromechanics theory developed by Prof. [Ronaldo I. Borja](https://web.stanford.edu/~borja/), Prof. [Alexander H.-D. Cheng](http://home.olemiss.edu/~acheng/), and Prof. [Olivier Coussy](https://doi.org/10.1002/nag.911). I am also eager to learn the Nonlinear Finite Element Methods, especially the finite-strain elastoplasticity in geomechanics. I collaborate with Prof. [Xia Yan](http://pe.upc.edu.cn/2019/1107/c14043a224742/page.htm) from the [Research Center of Multiphase Flow in Porous Media](http://oilcenter.pe.upc.edu.cn/main.htm) (led by Prof. Jun Yao).
