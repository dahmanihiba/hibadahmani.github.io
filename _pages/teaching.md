## Stanford University
### CEE 294 (Currently changed to CEE 314) â€“ Computational Poromechanics (Spring 2018)
* The course deals with the mechanics of porous media focusing on coupled solid deformation-fluid flow phenomena. Porous media are encountered in many areas of engineering and science, including biomechanics, physical chemistry, materials science, geomechanics, geosciences, and petroleum engineering. In this class, we will derive the balance laws for saturated and unsatrated porous media, develop the weak and matrix forms for finite element implementation, and solve boundary-value problems using the finite element software ANSYS.
