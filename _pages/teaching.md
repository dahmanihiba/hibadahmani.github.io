## Stanford University
### CEE 294 (Currently changed to CEE 314) – Computational Poromechanics (Spring 2018)
* The course deals with the mechanics of porous media focusing on coupled solid deformation-fluid flow phenomena. Porous media are encountered in many areas of engineering and science, including biomechanics, physical chemistry, materials science, geomechanics, geosciences, and petroleum engineering. In this class, we will derive the balance laws for saturated and unsatrated porous media, develop the weak and matrix forms for finite element implementation, and solve boundary-value problems using the finite element software ANSYS.


## The Hong Kong Polytechnic University
### CSE583 - Analytical and Numerical Methods in Geotechnical Engineering (Jan 2023)
* Stress analysis; strain analysis; elasticity; plasticity; some typical soil models

* Fundamental concept of plasticity theory; limit equilibrium method; limit analysis methods; upper and lower bound principles – applications to bearing capacity, lateral earth pressure problems, and slope stability

### CE620 - Research Methods (Sep 2023)
#### Statistical analysis and modelling
Linear regression. Multiple linear regression. Geographical weighted regression. Robust regression. Outliers detection. Association rules mining. Clustering. Time series analysis. Big data analysis.

#### Result interpretation: Statistical significance tests
Steps in Testing for Statistical Significance. Selection of a probability of error level (alpha level). Various tests (Chi square test, T-Test, U-test, Z-test). Interpretation of test results.
