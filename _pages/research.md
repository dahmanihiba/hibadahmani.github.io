## Continuum modeling of double porosity media
- Self-consistent extension of linear poroelasticity to overlapping scales of porosity within fluid-saturated anisotropic materials is developed.

## Roof water inrush in mining engineering
- An in-house similar simulation experiment was conducted to reveal the whole process of roof water inrush
- An analytical model for wing crack initiation was derived, in order to theoretically interpret the evolution of water-conducting fractured zone
- Apply data science to the prediction of water abundance of loose aquifer and to the assessment of reclamation of subsided land caused by coal mining
