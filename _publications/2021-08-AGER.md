In double porosity media, fluid could flow through the distributed micro-fractures at a larger scale as well as through the nanopores of the organic matrix at a smaller scale, while fluid mass could be transferred between them. Besides, the solid deformation acts as an important coupling term and leads to the two-way coupled process. However, these processes are not well presented in previous studies. In this work, a new coupled modeling approach was proposed for saturated double porosity media with strong permeability contrast. Specifically, the transversely isotropic equivalent fracture permeability is considered for the preferentially oriented micro-fractures at the micro-scale or meso-scale; while at the nano-scale, the non-Darcy flow and mass transfer equations are employed to consider the interaction between fluid particles and the solid pore wall. Finally, the stabilized finite element method is developed to investigate the settlement and pressure dissipation behaviors of the strip load problem.
